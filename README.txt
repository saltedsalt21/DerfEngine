=====================================
This game engine is a very simple engine that as of 3/17/23 can only display images. 
It is built using the C++ programming language and the SDL2 libraries. 
The game engine can load images in various formats, including BMP, PNG, and JPEG, and display them on the screen supported by the SDL2 libraries.
Images can also be positioned and scaled as desired.

This game engine is suitable for creating simple 2D games or applications that require only basic graphics functionality. 
It is a good starting point for developers who are learning game development or general programming standards.
